### Decision Service

#### Functionality

* Evaluates an __Interview__
* Provides a __Decision__ based on a versioned set of "Decision Tables" _Note:_ This service supports multiple versions of Decision Tables, this version is 'addressed' in the version number in the request and response JSON. 


## Request

* Body contains an __Interview__ JSON
- A [JSON Schema](../test/resources/schema/off-payroll-request-schema.json) defines this __Interview__.
- [Example](../test/resources/schema/off-payroll-request-sample.json) JSON with all fields populated.


| Attribute        | Required           | Description                                                          |
| :---------------- |:------------------:| :--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| version          | true               | The version of the Interview being used and therefore the endpoint |
| correlationID    | true               | A value unique to the consumer, to identify this Interview and correlate to its Decision|
| interview       | true               | A set of questions and answers grouped in clusters used to conduct the Interview |
| personalService | false               | cluster |
| control           | false             | cluster |
| financialRisk   | false               | cluster |
| businesStructure| false               | cluster |
| partOfOrganisation| false             | cluster |
| miscellaneous| false                  | cluster |

 _Note:_ The __Interview__ does not need to contain all the clusters. Within each cluster there are a number of __ClusterElements__ a ClusterElement represents a Question with an answer. For a complete list of  __ClusterElements__ refer to the [JSON Schema](../test/resources/schema/off-payroll-request-schema.json) Once all the __Clusters__ are present in this __Interview__ then a __Decision__ response will be present. Depending on how the __Interview__ has been formed a __Decision__ may be arrived at before all __Clusters__ and __ClusterElements__ are present, this is known as a __Hard Exit__


## Response

* HTTP 200 OK

- A [JSON Schema](../test/resources/schema/off-payroll-response-schema.json) defines this __Decision__.
- [Example](../test/resources/schema/off-payroll-response-sample.json) JSON with all fields populated.
