### Decision Service

#### Functionality

* Evaluates a "QuestionSet"
* Provides a Decision based on a versioned set of "Decision Tables" _Note:_ This service supports multiple versions of Decision Tables, this version is 'addressed' in the version of the URL and the version number in the request and response JSON. 


## Request

* Body contains QuestionSet JSON

```json
	{
	  "version": "1.0",
	  "correlation-id": "48fd5b38-9047-4d9b-983e-27fb2c5360dd",

| version          | true               | The version of the QuestionSet being used and therefore the endpoint |
| correlation-id   | true               | Unique number to identify this QuestionSet and correlate it to its  decision |

| miscellaneous| false              | Part of the Question Set  ...|

 _Note:_ does not need to contain all the sections. Once all the sections are present in this array then a Decision response will be present. Though depending on the QuestionSet a Decision can be arrived at before all sections are present, this is known as a 'hard-exit'
